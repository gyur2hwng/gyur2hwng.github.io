    <h1>Hi, I'm Gyuri!</h1>
    <p> I'm a '23 at Dartmouth majoring in Computer Science and minoring in
      Human Centered Design. On campus, I'm involved in Women in
      Computer Science, Dartmouth College Wind Ensemble, and
      Dartmouth Asian Dance Troupe. <br><br>

        I lived in Japan and China for four years each when I was little, but
        afterwards grew up in Seoul, South Korea and came to New Hampshire
        to go to Dartmouth! <br><br>
    </p>

    <h3>CS</h3>
    <p> Programming languages that I am comfortable using are Java and
      Python. I also use HTML, CSS, Javascript, and SQL, along with JSP and
      MVC2. <br><br>

      The thing I love about development is that if you have the skill, you can
      achieve a goal and get the output very quickly. Also, isn't it just very
      intriguing how you can basically create anything you imagine through development? <br><br>

    <h3>Interests</h3>
    <p> During my leisure time I enjoy watching Netflix and Youtube, testing
      perfumes and fragrances, planning out potential travel itinerary, and
      just cuddling with my golden. I also love to dance to k-pop, explore
      vintage shops, and sleep. <br><br>

      You can find me on <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gyuri-hwang-91965b1b5/">LinkedIn</a></strong>
      and <strong><a href="https://github.com/gyur2hwng?tab=repositories">Github</a></strong>.
